# MyTextEditor
Simple text editor. Is able to Open, Create, Edit, Save (and "Save as...") text files, Undo, Redo actions, Copy, Cut and Paste text. Also, the system searches a text in file. The search word is highlighted. The idea is taken from the site [proglib.io](https://proglib.io/p/project-list/)
